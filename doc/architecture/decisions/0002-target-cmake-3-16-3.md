# 2. Target CMake 3.16.3

Date: 2021-02-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our project should be easily adoptable by the community.
It should work out of the box on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system.

## Decision

Our target CMake version is 3.16.3.

## Consequences

We can't use newer CMake features like the JSON string API.
